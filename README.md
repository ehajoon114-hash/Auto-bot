# 👑 Project: PHANTOM AXIE - THE STEALTH ENGINE 👑
### *The Only Bot Built for Long-Term, Undetected Profit.*

## 💀 THE PROBLEM: High-Risk, Low-Reward Scripts

The market is flooded with reckless automation. Scripts that inject DLLs, read process memory, or flood the API are **disposable**. They get you banned on the first patch cycle.

You want **passive income**, not a ticking clock on your investment. You need a system that plays the game the way **Sky Mavis sees it:** a human looking at a screen and clicking.

## ✅ THE SOLUTION: Pure Visual-Layer Automation

Welcome to **Phantom Axie**. We skip the dangerous anti-cheat territory (kernel-level, memory hooks) entirely. Our engine uses an advanced **Visual Input Relay (VIR)** system powered by the most stable, trusted functions in the OS: the **Windows API**.

**This isn't cheating. This is superior vision and tireless execution.**

## ⚙️ The Undetectable Core: Windows API Fortress

Our entire operation happens on the visual layer, making the bot virtually invisible to conventional anti-cheat scans. It works by taking screenshots and recognizing pixels of Axie models and cards, a method far safer than memory access.

| Function Category | Goal | Key Windows API Functions Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Visual Acquisition** | Securely capture game state without memory intrusion. | `GetDC`, `ReleaseDC` |
| **State Analysis** | Rapidly identify Axies, cards, energy, and turn status. | `GetPixel` |
| **Memory Context** | Handle the transfer of color data within the OS environment. | `BitBlt` |
| **Resource Management** | Create and safely dispose of memory device contexts and objects. | `CreateCompatibleDC`, `DeleteDC`, `CreateCompatibleBitmap`, `DeleteObject`, `SelectObject` |

> **🔥 Maximize Profit Safely:** The bot only "sees" the game display. Sky Mavis's anti-cheat sees standard Windows OS calls for screen rendering. **The detection risk is minimized to near zero.**

## ⚠️ Operational Security (OpSec) Warning

* **Limit:** It is **not recommended** to run the bot for more than **24 consecutive hours per account**. Integrate human-like login/logout patterns. **Protect your assets—be disciplined.**
